## The Paper Is a Narrative

An ideal AI paper is a short, rigorous, evidence-based technical story with a takeaway the reader cares about.

### What to do

Build the entire paper around:

- **What?** 1–3 concrete claims (your contribution to knowledge)
- **Why?** rigorous evidence that supports those claims
- **So what?** motivation + impact (why a reader should care)

Everything else exists to support this narrative.

### Reader reality

Many readers only see:
**title → abstract → intro/figures skim → stop**.

So optimize for:

- clarity of narrative
- credibility of evidence
- memorability of takeaway

### Checklist

- Can I state the paper’s narrative in 2–5 sentences?
- Are there 1–3 explicit claims?
- Does every major section support the claims?
- Do the abstract + intro + figures stand alone as a coherent summary?
- Is the evidence strong enough for a skeptical reader?
