## Make the Reader Care

Your narrative needs motivation and impact. Always answer: **Why should anyone care?**

### What to do

For each claim, write three pieces:

1. **Context:** Where does this sit in AI / why this topic is real?
2. **Need/gap:** What’s unknown, missing, or wrong?
3. **Impact:** What changes if your claim is true? Who should update beliefs or behavior?

### Output template

- **Motivation (context):** …
- **Problem / gap:** …
- **Impact / takeaway:** …
- **Who cares:** …

### Checklist

- Is motivation specific (not generic “X is important”)?
- Does impact follow from the actual claim, not vibes?
- Could a reader repeat the takeaway in one sentence?

### Common failure modes

- Generic framing, no concrete gap
- Impact not tied to evidence scope
- Overselling implications without limitations
