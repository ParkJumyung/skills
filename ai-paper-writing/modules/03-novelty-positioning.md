## Be Explicit About What’s Novel

Novelty means your work expands our knowledge. Make it easy for readers (and reviewers) to tell what changed because of your paper.

### What to do

1. Identify the closest prior work (top 5).
2. For each prior work:
   - what they showed
   - what you reuse/build on
   - what you do differently
   - why that difference matters
3. In the intro, explicitly label:
   - **Builds on:** …
   - **Novel contribution:** …
4. If criticizing prior work:
   - stay professional
   - specify the flaw and why it matters
   - show how your method resolves it

### Novelty test

Ask:  
“Should a reader assign different probabilities to propositions they care about after seeing these results?”

### Output template

- **Novelty bullets:**
  - Novel: …
  - Builds on: …
  - Differs from: …
- **Closest-work map:** paper → overlap → difference → why it matters

### Common failure modes

- Reader can’t tell what’s new
- Claims sound arrogant or undersell
- Missing key citations to closest work
