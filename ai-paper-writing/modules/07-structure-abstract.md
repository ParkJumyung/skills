## Write an Abstract That Stands Alone

The abstract is the highest-leverage part of the paper. Many readers won’t go further.

### What to do

Use sentence roles:

1. **Context:** what subfield / topic and why it’s real.
2. **Gap/need:** what’s unknown/problematic.
3. **Core contribution/claim:** what you show + why it’s exciting.
4. **Clarifier (optional):** definition or how evidence connects.
   5–N. **Evidence + secondary claims:** 1 sentence per idea; include a concrete metric/result if possible.
   Final 1–2. **Impact:** takeaway, implications, standard of evidence.

### Checklist

- Would a cold-start reader know the “genre” of the paper?
- Are claims explicit (not implied)?
- Is there at least one concrete result/metric (when applicable)?
- Is jargon minimized or defined?

### Common failure modes

- Too technical too early
- No clear claim
- No evidence
- No impact/takeaway
