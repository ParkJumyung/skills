## Make Figures Communicate the Takeaway

Figures are a primary channel for communicating results. Put serious effort into them.

### What to do

For each figure:

1. Decide the **takeaway** (one sentence).
2. Choose a visualization that emphasizes the takeaway.
3. Make interpretation easy:
   - readable axes/ticks
   - clear legend
   - annotation/highlighting for key lines/patterns
4. Write a caption that includes:
   - what is shown
   - experimental conditions
   - how to interpret
   - caveats if needed

### Checklist

- If someone only sees the figure + caption, do they get the point?
- Is the plotted quantity tied to a claim?
- Are the conditions and baselines clear?

### Common failure modes

- Figure shows numbers but no message
- Caption lacks setup/conditions
- Visual clutter hides the key effect
