## Use Related Work to Clarify Differences

Related work exists to help readers understand how your paper fits into the literature.

### What to do

- Focus on the closest work and explain:
  - what they did
  - what you share
  - what you do differently
  - why it matters
- If your work fixes a flaw:
  - state politely
  - specify the flaw and its consequence
  - explain how you resolve it

### Checklist

- Are the closest neighbors covered?
- Is “difference” explicit or implied?
- Does the reader know what to cite you for?

### Common failure modes

- Citation laundry list without clarity
- Defensive or personal critique tone
