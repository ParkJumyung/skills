## State Limitations to Calibrate Belief

Readers must understand limitations to correctly update beliefs.

### What to do

1. List the biggest limitations:
   - evidence scope
   - confounds
   - generalization gaps
2. For each limitation:
   - how it affects claim strength
   - what experiment would reduce it
3. If useful, discuss broader implications and future work.

### Checklist

- Are limitations specific and tied to claims?
- Should any claim be hedged or narrowed given limitations?
- Did we avoid hype and clearly calibrate confidence?

### Common failure modes

- Hiding limitations to sound exciting
- Generic limitations that don’t change interpretation
