## Write Iteratively: Compress Then Expand

Writing is part of research. It clarifies thinking and exposes gaps.

### What to do

#### Compress

- Explain the work to someone; ask what’s most interesting.
- Plan a talk.
- Have an LLM summarize notes, then critique it.
  Iterate until you have:
- 1–3 claims
- why they matter
- 1–3 key experiments per claim

#### Expand (recommended sequence)

1. Abstract draft
2. Bullet narrative
3. Intro bullet outline
4. Full paper outline
5. Figures draft
6. Prose draft
7. Edit aggressively; repeat

#### Feedback strategy

Get feedback early on narrative/outline (fast to critique), not only on dense prose.

### Checklist

- Did I write the abstract early and iterate?
- Did I outline before drafting prose?
- Did I get feedback at each stage?

### Common failure modes

- Writing treated as an afterthought
- Illusion of transparency (assuming reader context)
