## Avoid the Classic Paper-Writing Traps

### Trap: obsessing over publishability

Peer review rewards shininess and familiarity. Prefer scientific value; wrap for conference norms at the end if needed.

### Trap: unnecessary complexity and verbosity

If readers don’t understand, they ignore it (or assume it’s BS). Use plain language and keep jargon only where it increases precision.

### Trap: not prioritizing writing

Your work only matters if people understand it. Iterate on abstract/intro/figures early.

### Trap: discarding tacit knowledge

Troubleshooting, “what broke,” replication tips, and intuitions are often valuable. Put them in:

- appendix A
- companion blog post

### Checklist

- Did I simplify language without losing precision?
- Did I explicitly calibrate claims and limitations?
- Did I preserve high-value tacit knowledge somewhere?
