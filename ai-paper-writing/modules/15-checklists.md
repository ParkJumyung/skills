## Paper Writing Checklists

### Narrative

- Can I state the paper’s narrative in 2–5 sentences?
- Are there 1–3 concrete claims?
- Do claims fit a cohesive theme?

### Evidence

- For each claim: 1–3 key experiments?
- Do experiments discriminate hypotheses?
- Are baselines strong and tuned?
- Are there ablations for multi-part methods?
- Did we red-team bugs/confounds?

### Clarity

- Are key terms defined?
- Does intro summarize claims + evidence + novelty + impact?
- Do figures + captions stand alone?

### Integrity

- Are limitations explicit and tied to claims?
- Am I informing rather than persuading?
- Did I avoid cherry-picking or disclose selection?
- Did I mark post-hoc vs pre-specified?

### Process

- Did I iterate: abstract → outline → draft → edit?
- Did I get feedback early?
