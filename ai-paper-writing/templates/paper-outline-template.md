## Paper Outline Template

Use this to plan a paper where each section has a clear role in supporting 1–3 claims.

### How to use

- If you can’t answer “what goes wrong if I cut this?”, cut it.
- Layer detail: high-level → figures → body → appendix.

### Fill-in

## Narrative (top-level)

- Claims (1–3):
  1.
  2.
  3.
- Why should the reader care?
- Key evidence per claim (1–3 items each):

## Abstract

- (use Abstract Template)

## Introduction

## Background

- Key terms to define:
- Concepts readers may lack context for:
- Minimal necessary prior work:

## Methods

- Experimental setup:
- Models:
- Data:

## Results

- Key figure(s):
- Key quantitative results:
- Key qualitative results (if any):
- Sanity checks:

### Claim 2 results (optional)

- …

### Claim 3 results (optional)
