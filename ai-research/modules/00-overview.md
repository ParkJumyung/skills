## Overview: Explore → Understand → Distill

Research often feels messy because you’re holding yourself to the wrong standard for the stage you’re actually in.

This bundle breaks research into three core stages (plus ideation), each with a different “north star”:

- **Ideation:** choose a problem / direction
- **Exploration:** gain surface area
  - **North star:** information gained per unit time
- **Understanding:** test hypotheses
  - **North star:** evidence that convinces you a key hypothesis is true/false
- **Distillation:** compress, refine, communicate
  - **North star:** concise, defensible, communicable truth

## How stages relate

### Exploration → Understanding

Exploration produces:

- a map of the space
- interesting anomalies
- candidate hypotheses
- a sense of which questions matter

Understanding begins when you can:

- write down specific hypotheses, and
- describe what evidence would change your mind

### Understanding → Distillation

Distillation begins when:

- you’re fairly convinced about the key hypotheses, and
