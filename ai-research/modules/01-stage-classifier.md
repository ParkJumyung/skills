## Stage classifier

Correctly identifying the stage is often the highest-leverage move.

### You are in **Exploration** if:

- You don’t yet have crisp hypotheses
- You’re unsure what questions matter
- Results feel scattered but informative
- You’re saying “I should already know what’s going on”

**North star:** information gained per unit time

---

### You are in **Understanding** if:

- You can write down specific hypotheses
- You know what evidence would change your mind
- Experiments are designed to distinguish explanations
- Confounds and baselines matter a lot

**North star:** evidence that convinces you

---

### You are in **Distillation** if:

- You mostly believe your conclusions
- The confusion is about _claims_, _scope_, or _communication_
- Writing reveals missing experiments
- You’re preparing a paper, blog post, or report

**North star:** concise, defensible, communicable truth

---

### If unsure

Default to **Exploration** for 30–90 minutes:

- Run surface-area experiments
- Then reclassify

Misclassifying early stages as “understanding” is a common junior failure mode.
