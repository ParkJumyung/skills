## Ideation: choosing a problem

Ideation ranges from:

- broad exploration across areas to find a promising angle, to
- being handed a problem by a mentor.

### What to do

1. If new, start by replicating/extending a strong existing paper.
2. Get a quick map of the literature:
   - what’s known
   - what’s open
   - what adjacent work is relevant
3. Prefer mentorship or high-quality research agendas early.
4. Build hands-on experience before trying to “know everything” in the literature.

### Taste shows up here

Problem choice is one facet of taste. Taste also governs:

- which anomalies are interesting (exploration)
- which experiments distinguish hypotheses (understanding)
- what narrative/claims are defensible (distillation)

### Output

- candidate problem list (3–10)
- why each might matter
- fastest “sign of life” tests / mini-projects
- an initial reading list (5–15 items)
