## Exploration: information gain

Exploration is about **learning what questions to ask**, not validating specific theories.

### North star

Maximize **information gained per unit time**.

---

## What to do

1. Run many small, cheap experiments
2. Visualize data in multiple ways
3. Follow curiosity and anomalies
4. Keep a highlights doc of interesting results
5. Move fast; avoid perfectionism

Ask frequently:

> “Am I learning enough per unit time?”

If the answer is no, change tactics.

---

## Prioritization heuristic

When usefulness is unclear, prioritize by:

- speed
- tractability
- diversity of perspectives

Fast, messy experiments often teach more than slow “correct” ones.

---

## Common failure modes

- Expecting a clear hypothesis too early
- Over-optimizing for “the best experiment”
- Getting stuck because you feel you _should_ understand already
- Not zooming out to ask “what else could be going on?”

---

## Output

- List of surprising observations
- Candidate hypotheses worth testing
- Updated sense of what questions matter
