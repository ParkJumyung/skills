## Understanding: hypotheses & evidence

You are in understanding once you can articulate what you believe and why.

### North star

Gather evidence that convinces **you** a hypothesis is true or false.

---

## Core loop

1. Write down hypotheses explicitly
2. For each hypothesis:
   - What does it predict?
   - What evidence would change your mind?
3. Design experiments that distinguish _plausible alternatives_
4. Implement strong baselines
5. Check for bugs and confounds

## Good experiments

A great experiment:

- cleanly distinguishes explanations
- tests non-trivial predictions
- is tractable in practice

You won’t always get this ideal — aim toward it.

## Fast-fail question

> “If this hypothesis is wrong, how could I discover that as fast as possible?”

Often several small tests beat one large, slow one.

---

## Common failure modes

- Falling in love with a hypothesis
- Ignoring boring alternative explanations
- Weak or missing baselines
- Cherry-picked qualitative examples

---

## Output

- Refined hypotheses
- Evidence map (hypothesis → experiment → risk)
- Clear next experiments
