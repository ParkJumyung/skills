## Distillation: communicable truth

Distillation begins when you’re fairly convinced about the key hypotheses.
The work shifts from “what’s going on?” to “what exactly can we claim, and how do we justify it?”

### North star

Compress findings into concise, rigorous truth you can communicate to the world.

## Core principles

### 1) Compress into well-scoped claims

- Aim for **1–5 claims** (often 1–3 for most readers).
- Compress as far as possible without losing the message.

Prompts:

- How would you explain this to a peer?
- What would you say in a lightning talk?

### 2) Refine evidence into a rigorous case

Raise the bar above “convincing yourself”:

- strong baselines
- sanity checks
- robustness/statistical checks (as appropriate)
- legibility for outsiders

### 3) Red-team hard

- What alternative hypotheses explain the observations?
- What experiments distinguish them?
- What would a skeptical reader attack?

### 4) Communicate clearly (inform, not persuade)

Make:

- claims
- evidence
- limitations
  explicit.

Format doesn’t matter (paper/blog/report). Clarity does.

## Common distortions

- Under-rating distillation (“writing is wasting time”): writing forces clarity and reveals missing experiments.
- Over-rating “acceptance optimization”: choosing narratives for reviewers rather than truth.

Returning to understanding/exploration is normal if writing reveals gaps.

## Output

- claim list (scoped, precise)
- claim → evidence map
- limitations / open questions
- missing experiments list (ranked)
