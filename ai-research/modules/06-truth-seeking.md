## Truth-seeking

By default, many research insights will be false unless you actively resist bias.

A common failure mode: a simple boring explanation exists and nobody tests it.

### Truth-seeking in exploration

Failure modes:

- getting attached to the first plausible hypothesis
- failing to generate alternative hypotheses

What to do:

1. Resist entering “understanding” too early:
   - Are there unexplained anomalies?
   - Do you have enough surface area?
2. Regularly zoom out:
   - “What else could explain this?”
   - ask a mentor/peer
   - ask an LLM for cheap alternative hypotheses
3. It’s okay to believe false things briefly — but reflexively try to falsify them.

Watch for the opposite failure mode:

- being so skeptical you never explore implications enough to design good tests.

### Truth-seeking in understanding

What to do:

1. Use a comparative framing:
   - “Is this observation more likely under A or B?”
2. Prefer quantitative checks when possible.
3. If using qualitative cases:
   - sample randomly or use multiple examples
   - avoid cherry-picking

Exception:

- “there exists at least one example of X” claims.

### Truth-seeking in distillation

What to do:

- don’t pick narratives because they look good
- publish negative results when informative
- acknowledge key limitations and uncertainty

### Output

- list of plausible alternative explanations
- baseline/ablation checklist
- “what would change my mind?” statements
