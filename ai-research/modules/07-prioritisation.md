## Prioritisation

Time is scarce and the action space is huge. Projects live or die by choosing good actions.

### Requires

- a clear north star (stage goal)
- judgment about which actions serve it
- time to reflect
- willingness to drop directions (while respecting switching costs)

### Stage goals

- Ideation: pick a fruitful problem
- Exploration: gain surface area
- Understanding: convince yourself of key hypotheses
- Distillation: produce concise, well-supported truth

---

## Practical structure

### Ask regularly

> “Do I endorse what I’m doing, and could I be doing something better?”

### Use 3 tiers

- **Goal** (months): overall north star
- **Sub-goal** (weeks): current chunk
- **Objective** (days): concrete outcome

### Plan lightly (especially in understanding/distillation)

- rough time estimates
- identify uncertainties
- question necessity

### If stuck

Set a 5-minute timer:

- brainstorm 10 possible actions
- pick the best by (expected value) / (time)

### Separate prioritizing from executing

- zoom out to decide
- then lock in and execute without constant re-litigation

## Weekly review prompts

- What is my goal right now?
- What progress have I made?
- What consumed the most time?
- What blocked me?
- What mistakes did I make, and how could I systematically change my approach?
- What am I confused about?
- Am I missing something?

### Output

- ranked action list with “why now”
- next objective with “done” criteria
- explicit deprioritized items
