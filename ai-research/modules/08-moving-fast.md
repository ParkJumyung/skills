## Moving fast

Moving fast is not “work more hours” or “cut corners.”
It’s reducing friction while keeping the work honest.

Key levers:

- tight feedback loops
- good tooling
- noticing/fixing inefficiency
- acting under uncertainty (avoid analysis paralysis)

- [Tight feedback loops](modules/09-tight-feedback-loops.md)
- [Fail fast](modules/10-fail-fast.md)
- [Action under uncertainty](modules/11-action-under-uncertainty.md)

### Output

- shortest path from idea → result
- a tooling/automation improvement list
- a fast-first experiment plan
