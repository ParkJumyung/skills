## Fail fast

A major time sink is spending weeks/months on a doomed direction.

Ask:

> If this direction is doomed, how could I discover that as fast as possible?

### Understanding-stage fail-fast

1. Identify confident predictions of the hypothesis.
2. Design the quickest dirtiest test for those predictions.
3. Run several small tests from different angles.

### Exploration-stage fail-fast

1. Identify fundamental assumptions that make the domain interesting.
2. Test those assumptions with minimal experiments.
3. If they fail, pivot early.

### Output

- a ranked list of “decisive tests”
- an explicit pivot criterion
