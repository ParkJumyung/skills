## Taking action under uncertainty

You often can’t know the “right” next step. In practice, there isn’t one.

### What to do

1. Accept uncertainty emotionally: you won’t get certainty before acting.
2. Make a best guess from noisy evidence.
3. Act anyway.
4. Stay self-aware enough to notice when it’s no longer best.
5. Treat bad calls as data that improves your judgment next time.

Especially early:

- the learning value dominates
- stakes are low
- moving beats freezing

### Output

- 1–2 concrete next actions with “done” criteria
- a re-evaluation trigger (“if X happens, reconsider”)
