## Research taste: overview

Taste is often treated as mystical. It’s real and valuable, but largely learned.

Taste = the intuitions and judgments that guide ambiguous research decisions:

- which anomalies to chase
- which experiments will be compelling vs inconclusive
- what narrative is defensible and interesting

New researchers lacking taste is normal.
You can start anyway.

### Analogy

Taste develops like training a model:

- bad initialization
- needs diverse high-quality data
- improves with feedback over time

Hard part:

- feedback for strategic taste is slow and noisy

### Output

- a “taste training loop” for the project
- a list of decisions worth reflecting on
