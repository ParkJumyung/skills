## Decomposing taste: ingredients

Taste is a bundle of interacting parts.

### 1) Intuition (System 1)

Fast gut feelings:

- “promising”
- “rabbit hole”
- “important anomaly”

Built slowly via exposure and feedback.

### 2) Conceptual framework (System 2)

Domain knowledge and principles that:

- generate hypotheses
- spot inconsistencies
- constrain what’s plausible
- enable better experiments

### 3) Strategic big picture

Sense of:

- what problems matter
- what counts as a meaningful contribution
- what approaches have been tried

Aim to align curiosity with importance rather than forcing obligation.

### 4) Conviction & confidence

Conviction can maintain momentum through setbacks.
But it can also lock you into wrong ideas.

Ideal: strategic conviction

- act confidently to make progress
- zoom out regularly to stay skeptical and update

### Output

- a list of which “taste component” is currently limiting progress
- a targeted plan to improve it
