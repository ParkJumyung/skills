## Cultivating research taste

Improve taste like improving a model:

- more/better data
- better sample-efficiency

---

## Learn more from each data point

Each data point is richer than success/failure.

What to do:

1. Make explicit predictions (write them down).
2. Act (run experiment / ask mentor / read paper).
3. Review accuracy.
4. Post-mortem:
   - what did I miss?
   - what heuristic would have helped?
   - what do I do differently next time?

Keep a research log.

## Get more data

### Mentors (biggest accelerator)

Treat mentors like supervised data.

- predict their advice first
- when surprised, ask “what heuristic did you use?”
- paraphrase their reasoning back in your own words

### Learn critically from papers

- predict methods/results/limitations before reading
- reconstruct the thought process
- engage with flaws (papers are often flawed)

### Collaborate and discuss

Explaining forces clarity and surfaces alternative perspectives.

### Prefer clearer feedback early

Projects with testable intermediate hypotheses teach faster than long moonshots.

---

## Feedback loops determine learning speed

- tactical taste (minutes–days) improves faster
- strategic taste (months–years) improves slower

### Output

- a weekly reflection routine
- a prediction/post-mortem log
- a plan to use mentors/papers more actively
