## Common failure modes (and fixes)

### 1) Misclassified stage

Symptom: “I’m stuck because I don’t have a hypothesis”
Fix: you’re probably in exploration → optimize information gain.

### 2) Too-early commitment

Symptom: one hypothesis dominates too fast
Fix: generate alternatives; keep exploring until anomalies are explained.

### 3) Weak skepticism

Symptom: results feel exciting but fragile
Fix: baselines, confounds, bug checks, alternative explanations.

### 4) Over-optimization / perfectionism

Symptom: slow progress, few experiments
Fix: more small experiments; prioritize info/evidence per unit time.

### 5) Long cycle times

Symptom: each iteration takes days/weeks
Fix: shrink the loop: smallest model/data; partial evals; notebook workflow.

### 6) Distillation avoidance

Symptom: “writing is wasting time”
Fix: start distillation early; writing reveals missing experiments.

### 7) Reviewer-optimization (distortion)

Symptom: chasing what looks good over what’s true
Fix: keep truth as north star; state limitations; publish negative results.
