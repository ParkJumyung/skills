## Experiment Plan

**Hypothesis (H):**

- Statement:

**Alternative hypotheses (A1, A2, …):**

- A1:
- A2:

**Predictions**

- If H is true, I expect:
- If A1 is true, I expect:
- If A2 is true, I expect:

**Experiment design**

- Setup:
- Variables manipulated:
- Measurements:
- Dataset / prompts / sampling:
- Analysis method:

**Baselines / controls**

- Baseline 1:
- Baseline 2:
- Negative control:
- Sanity checks:

**Confounds / failure modes**

- Potential confound 1:
- Potential confound 2:
- Bug risks:

**Success criteria / decision rule**

- What result would support H?
- What result would falsify H?
- What result would be inconclusive?

**Runtime / cost**

- Expected time:
- Compute:
- Dependencies:

**Next actions**

- If supports H:
- If falsifies H:
- If inconclusive:
