## Hypothesis ↔ Evidence Map

Fill one row per hypothesis or claim.

| Hypothesis / Claim | Supporting evidence | Key baselines / sanity checks | Main alternative explanations | Missing discriminator | Confidence |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
|                    |                     |                               |                               |                       |            |
|                    |                     |                               |                               |                       |            |

### Notes

- Which row is weakest, and why?
- What single experiment would increase confidence the most?
