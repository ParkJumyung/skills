## Research Intake Template

Use this to quickly provide the context needed to run triage.

### Project snapshot (1–5 sentences)

- What are you trying to learn or build?
- Why does it matter (to you / to the field / to an application)?

### Current state

- What have you tried so far?
- What are the most important results (even if messy)?
- What is currently confusing or blocking you?

### Artifacts (if available)

- Links/snippets to:
  - plots
  - tables
  - notebooks
  - notes
  - draft text
  - experiment logs

### Constraints

- Deadline (if any):
- Compute / budget constraints:
- Scope constraints (what you will/won’t do):

### What you want from this session

Pick one:

- Decide what to do next (unstuck)
- Design experiments to test a hypothesis
- Stress-test results (baselines / alternative explanations)
- Distill into claims + evidence + limitations
- Improve research taste / reflection loop
