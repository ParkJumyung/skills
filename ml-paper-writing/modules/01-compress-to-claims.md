## Compress Your Work Into 1–3 Claims

A paper’s narrative is fundamentally a contribution to our body of knowledge: **one to three specific claims** that fit a cohesive theme.

### What to do

1. Write a raw list of what you learned.
2. Choose the 1–3 most important items:
   - most exciting or important
   - hardest / most non-trivial
   - likely to matter to others
3. Turn each into a crisp claim with **scope** and **strength**.
4. State what would falsify each claim.

### Claim strength ladder (pick one)

- **Existence proof:** “We found at least one example where X happens.”
- **Systematic:** “X generally happens across a wide range of contexts.”
- **Hedged:** “There is suggestive/compelling/tentative evidence that X is true.”
- **Narrow:** “X is best in situations V/W for objective Y.”
- **Guarantee:** “X is always true.” (rare in deep learning)

### Claim template

- **Claim:** …
- **Scope:** models/tasks/data/regimes …
- **Strength:** existence/systematic/hedged/narrow/guarantee
- **Falsifier:** what result would make me retract/modify it?
- **Key evidence:** 1–3 experiments/analyses

### Common failure modes

- Too many claims (grab-bag paper)
- Vague claims (“improves performance” without scope/metric)
- Strong claims with weak evidence (overclaiming)
