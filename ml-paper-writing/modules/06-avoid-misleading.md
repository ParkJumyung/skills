## Avoid Cherry-Picking and Post-Hoc Storytelling

Evidence can look more compelling than it is if selection bias or post-hoc narratives creep in.

### What to do

#### Qualitative examples

- State selection method.
- Prefer random/context examples when possible.
- Exception: existence proof claims (one trustworthy example can suffice).

#### Pre vs post-hoc tracking

- Mark which experiments were planned before the claim vs after.
- Treat post-hoc interpretations as weaker evidence.

#### Alternative explanations

Ask: “Could the evidence be true but the claim false?”  
If yes, add tests to distinguish.

### Checklist

- Are examples cherry-picked?
- Did we clearly label post-hoc analyses?
- Could the same pattern arise from a confound?
- Did we add sanity checks?

### Common failure modes

- “Best examples only” presented as representative
- Post-hoc discoveries written like predictions
- Correct prediction for the wrong reason
