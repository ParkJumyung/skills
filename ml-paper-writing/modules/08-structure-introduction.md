## Write an Introduction That Summarizes the Whole Paper

The introduction should be a self-contained narrative summary. Don’t fear repetition.

### What to do

Suggested flow:

1. **Context + motivating question + why it matters** (cite liberally).
2. **Technical background + why current approaches are inadequate** (cite).
3. **Main claim + nuance + novelty labeling** (novel vs builds-on).
   3.5 **The case:** the most critical evidence in brief.
   (Optional) repeat for claim 2/3.
4. **Impact:** implications, who should care, what changes.
   End with **contribution bullets** (claims + brief evidence pointers).

### Checklist

- Could a reader stop after the intro and still get the narrative?
- Is novelty explicitly labeled?
- Is key evidence summarized (not deferred)?
- Are key terms defined or signposted?

### Common failure modes

- Intro doesn’t say what’s new
- Intro motivates but doesn’t summarize evidence
- Assumes too much reader context
