## Layer Technical Detail So Readers Can Verify

The main body is where you justify claims to an engaged skeptical reader.

### What to do

#### Layering principle

- high-level in abstract/intro
- results in figures
- increasing technical detail in main body + appendix

#### Define key terms

Readers have less context than you think. Err toward defining:

- key techniques
- key terms
- setup details that affect interpretation

#### Default structure

- **Background:** context, terminology, crucial techniques
- **Methods:** what you did + why it’s relevant
- **Results:** how methods were applied; what happened; interpretation

### Checklist

- Could someone reproduce the core results from the description?
- Are all crucial choices specified (data, models, metrics, preprocessing)?
- Are definitions placed where readers need them?

### Common failure modes

- Missing details that change interpretation
- Readers can’t replicate
- Sections that don’t support claims
